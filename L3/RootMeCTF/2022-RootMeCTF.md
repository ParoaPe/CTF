### Approach

Fun fact, this is the first CTF where I do programming challenges because my level was very bad, but now I work every day on python code and I have many TP about developments in Calais. So I decide to check programming challenges and there are affordable. 
This challenge need a connection to `netcat` and speak why machine to resolve RPN (calcul with Reverse Polish Notation). After many reflexions I had the flag.

**Challenge Description :** The last CVE that made the business world shiver! Will you be able to exploit it?

### Approach

This challenge was not revolved but I want to speack about it. It was in relation with new CVE on GLPI and it was fun to check how they work.

An exploit can be found easly on internet : https://mayfly277.github.io/posts/GLPI-htmlawed-CVE-2022-35914/

We can just use curl with the vulnerable library (htmlawed) in GLPI and we got command injection.

Despite my attempts to try and explore the reverse-shells that I found on the machine, I was unable to find a way to access the server. I could have tried to enumerate the server by hand to find a flag but I didn't take the time.

**Flag :** `RM{NOT_FOUND}`
